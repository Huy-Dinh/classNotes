FIRST DAY (Memories, bits, bytes, performance)
{
	MEMORY (){
		TRIVIA (lol){
		- Webs use big endian, uC uses little endian. Reasons unknown
		}
	}
	
	PERFORMANCE(){
		BENCHMARK(){
			- LINPACK
			- Whetstone
			- Dhrystone "DMIPS"
			- Coremark 
		}
		TRIVIA(){
			- mA/MHz caused by the need to charge caps when switching bits (Higher the frequency, higher the Amp)
		}
